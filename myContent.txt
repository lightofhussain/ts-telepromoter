Goal: 
    Our objective is to unite our community<br> under a single organization<br> 
    to establish a business that leverages <br>our collective resources and<br>
    skills for mutual benefit. This initiative<br> aims to break away from <br>
    the traditional donation culture and <br>create a sustainable, self sufficient<br>
    model that benefits everyone involved.<br>This idea represents a powerful <br>
    opportunity to harness our community's<br> strengths and foster economic growth.<br>
    However, its success will depend on <br>careful planning, strong community<br> 
    engagement,and a well defined business <br>strategy. To move forward effectively,<br>
    we need to understand the community's <br>readiness, the feasibility of our<br>
    proposed business model, and how we <br>can manage resources and operations effectively.<br>
